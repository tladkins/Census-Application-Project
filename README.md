# Census Application Project
This application is a console based application that demonstrates my skills in the C programming language.  
This application is a basic application intended to be used to store census data.

Using the application: 
1. Run the 'FinalProject2.sln' file in Visual Studio.
2. Click the 'Local Windows Debugger' button at the top of the page.
3. Follow the prompts given by the application.

Other Important Notes:
1. This application initially starts with no data. Becuase of this you will have to insert some data in order to get meaningful output.
